NEUROBRIDGE CAREGIVER DASHBOARD GUIDE
Audience: caregivers (parents, teachers, coaches, therapists, supporters). Goal: practical, strength-based support you can use daily.
CORE PRINCIPLES
1: Presume competence. Assume the person understands more than they can express. Speak respectfully.
2: Predictability reduces stress. Use routines, schedules, and warnings before changes.
3: Clear communication. Use concrete language. Break multi-step directions into single steps.
4: Regulation first. Learning and behavior improve after the nervous system is calm.
5: Strength-based support. Build on interests and what already works.
COMMUNICATION SUPPORT
Use short sentences. One idea per sentence. Give extra processing time.
Avoid idioms when they confuse meaning. Say exactly what you mean.
Pair speech with visuals when helpful (written steps, pictures, icons).
For minimally verbal or non-verbal users: respect AAC, typing, sign, gestures. Do not force eye contact. Ask yes/no or choice questions.
Fast tool: FIRST-THEN. Example: First shoes, then iPad. Use it for transitions.
SENSORY REGULATION
Watch for overload signs: covering ears, withdrawal, agitation, shutdown, increased stimming.
Reduce triggers: loud sound, bright light, crowds, strong smells, scratchy clothing.
Offer tools: fidgets, headphones, sunglasses, weighted lap pad, chew tool (if appropriate), quiet corner.
Schedule sensory breaks before overload. Micro-breaks (2 to 5 minutes) work.
EXECUTIVE FUNCTION SUPPORT
Break tasks into chunks with a clear start and finish.
Use checklists and visual task lists. Put them where the task happens.
Use timers and time warnings: 10 minutes, 5 minutes, 2 minutes, then transition.
Reduce distractions. Create a single clear workspace.
Fast tool: ONE-STEP PROMPT. Example: Put shoes on. Then: Zip jacket. Then: Grab backpack.
EMOTIONAL REGULATION
Teach coping tools when calm, not during crisis.
Co-regulate: lower your voice, reduce words, offer simple choices, slow your body.
After a meltdown or shutdown: prioritize safety and recovery. Do not lecture. Debrief later.
Fast tool: CALM-DOWN KIT. Include 3 to 5 items that reliably help (sensory, movement, preferred activity).
SOCIAL SUPPORT
Make hidden rules explicit. Many social rules are not intuitive.
Use role-play for tough scenarios: joining groups, disagreement, teasing, asking for help.
Use structured social time: clear start, activity, end time.
SCHOOL SUPPORT (COMMON ACCOMMODATIONS)
Preferential seating to reduce distractions.
Movement breaks and sensory tools.
Extra processing time and extended time for tests when needed.
Alternative ways to show learning (oral, project, visuals) when appropriate.
HOMEWORK SUPPORT
Same time, same place, same routine.
Chunk work into small pieces with breaks. Use a timer if it helps.
Check understanding first, then completion. Avoid repeated nagging.
INDEPENDENCE AND LIFE SKILLS
Teach self-advocacy: asking for breaks, asking for repetition, requesting accommodations.
Use task analysis: break skills into steps. Practice in real settings with extra time.
Celebrate progress. Track what improved, not only what is missing.
CAREGIVER SELF-CARE
Set realistic expectations. Not every day will be smooth.
Use a support network. Ask for help before burnout.
Fast tool: 60-SECOND RESET. Slow breathing, relax shoulders, drink water, step away if safe.
RED FLAGS: SEEK PROFESSIONAL HELP
Persistent self-harm, dangerous behavior, severe regression, inability to meet basic needs, extreme withdrawal, suspected abuse or trauma, caregiver cannot cope.
